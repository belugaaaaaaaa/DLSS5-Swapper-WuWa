// GPU-completion leases shared by the retirement paths (dlssnr.hpp) and the
// readback paths (dlssnr.hpp adaptation, screenshot.hpp).
//
// v5.2.2 proved GPU completion with present counts ("four presents means the
// queue flushed"): a blocked or slow GPU can be arbitrarily many CPU presents
// ahead of actual execution, so retired resources could be freed and readback
// buffers mapped while command lists referencing them were still in flight.
// Instead, every tracked command queue carries a signal fence advanced after
// each ExecuteCommandLists (the detour lives in dlssnr.hpp, which owns Detours
// and logging), and a lease records the fence values it must outlive.
//
// A lease never blocks and never allocates a CPU wait: readiness is a poll of
// ID3D12Fence::GetCompletedValue.  An empty lease means "no tracked queue
// could provide a fence". Screenshot diagnostics may settle on a bounded tick
// window (a torn diagnostic plane beats no plane), but meter readbacks are
// skip-until-proven, and resource retirement must treat an empty lease as
// unknown and keep the resource alive until teardown rather than infer GPU
// completion from CPU presents.
