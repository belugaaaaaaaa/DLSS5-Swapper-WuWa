// The release-build "last gasp" crash reporter.  Every build includes this
// header; debug.hpp's crash facility (minidumps, symbols, watchdog) stays
// DEBUG-only and is NOT enabled here - only the pieces a field report needs:
// one line in RenoDX-DLSS5-crash.log next to the game exe naming the
// faulting module, and the last release marks (the release stage the addon
// died in).
//
// Why a last-chance SetUnhandledExceptionFilter, not a vectored handler: the
// filter runs exactly once, for the exception that is about to kill the
// process.  A vectored handler (AddVectoredExceptionHandler) fires for every
// first-chance exception in the process, which in a game means the engine's
// own C++ EH (0xE06D7363), breakpoints, guard pages and heap probes - each
// one would need continuation semantics we do not own, and one misjudged
// benign code either floods the log or interferes with the game's recovery.
// At last chance there are no false positives: anything that arrives here is
// a real death, so every code is recorded (the owner's set - 0xC0000005,
// 0xC0000409, 0xC000001D, 0xC00000FD, 0xC0000374 - and anything else that
// got this far).  Known gaps, stated so support can recognize them: a
// genuine __fastfail (int 29h) never reaches user-mode dispatch at all
// (neither filter nor vectored; WER only), and a host that replaces the
// process's unhandled filter after we install ours takes the slot with it.
//
// Handler constraints (domain, not style): the crashing thread's heap, CRT
// file layer and possibly its locks are dead or held, so the handler only
// formats into a stack buffer (snprintf does not allocate) and writes with
// WriteFile/FlushFileBuffers on the handle pre-opened at install.  The file
// write comes BEFORE the best-effort reshade::log line, because that call
// can deadlock on ReShade's log mutex if the crashing thread held it - the
// file is the guarantee, the log line is a bonus.  The handler never
// swallows a crash: it hands it to the filter that was installed before it
// (the host's own crash reporter - RE Engine and most engines register one
// at start-up, before any add-on loads), or continues the search to WER when
// there was none.  Until v8.0.2 it returned EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH
// unconditionally, which at last chance does NOT reach the previous filter:
// installing this reporter took the host's crash handling away.
//
// v8.0.2: the first-chance recorder beside it.  The filter slot is one per
// process and the host decides who holds it: Unreal Engine installs its crash
// reporter after the addon has loaded, Special K keeps the slot for its own
// handler - and the v8.0.1 field crash log from Code Vein II (UE5) carried the
// session line and nothing else.  The vectored list cannot be taken over
// that way, and a vectored handler sees the fault on the faulting thread
// before any frame handler or filter decides its fate.  The noise the
// paragraph above warns about is kept out by scope, not by judgement: the
// recorder only RECORDS (always EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH, so nothing about
// the host's handling changes), only fatal-class codes, only faults inside
// this addon, an NGX or Streamline image, or an execute of an address that
// lies in no image (a freed trampoline, an unloaded module); faults this
// addon's own SEH wraps catch on purpose are skipped, repeats of the last
// address are not rewritten, and the process gets kFirstChanceLines lines.
// Since v8.5.0-rc9 one more code is in scope: a C++ throw on the thread
// inside an InsideCall (FirstChanceHandler).
// A "[first-chance]" line says the fault HAPPENED; a host that handled it
// leaves the line and a live process, so the last line before a session's
// end is the one to read.
