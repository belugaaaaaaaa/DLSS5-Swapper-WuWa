// Private-data keys owned by ONE loaded copy of this addon (ENV-03, rc11).
//
// D3D12 private data lives on the object and is process-wide: every module
// that asks for a GUID gets the same slot.  Two copies of this addon in one
// game (a Debug build beside the release one, or two versions under
// different names) used the same GUIDs, so each read the other's entries as
// its own.  The list-state object is a C++ object: one copy used and freed
// the other's with its own layout, and the game died at exit with heap
// corruption (0xC0000374) - 2 of 2 runs with both copies and NR off, 0 of 2
// with either copy alone, 0 of 2 with both copies on the striped table
// (NRListStateMode=0), which keeps no private data (hostile harness,
// env03-debug-beside-release).  Folding the module's load address into the
// key gives every loaded copy its own slots; a copy's keys never change
// while it is loaded.
