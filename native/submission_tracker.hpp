// Exact submission-use tracking for GPU object lifetime (v6 audit issue 01).
//
// A GpuLease (gpu_lease.hpp) snapshots `last_assigned + 1` for EVERY known
// queue: any queue's next submission proves the lease, whether or not that
// submission touched the guarded resources, and an idle queue starves every
// lease forever. This module replaces that guess for resource retention with
// the actual dependency graph:
//
//   - Recording a command that can reference an addon-owned GPU object
//     registers a USE on the list's current RECORDING GENERATION (everything
//     recorded between Reset calls; D3D12 requires recording to finish before
//     the first submit, so uses always precede the generation's submissions).
//   - ExecuteCommandLists attaches an exact (fence, value) completion token to
//     the submitted generations via a two-phase protocol (see
//     BeginSubmission/CompleteSubmission) that cannot be orphaned by a
//     concurrent Reset.
//   - A generation releases its uses only when it is closed (Reset/destroy:
//     replay impossible) AND every submission completed - or the device was
//     removed (UINT64_MAX fence), which is the existing retirement semantic.
//     A submission without a proof (faulted queue Signal) retains until
//     teardown, exactly like an unproven lease.
//
// D3D12 lifetime facts this depends on (Microsoft, "Recording command lists
// and bundles"): command lists do not retain referenced objects; a recorded
// list may be executed repeatedly until it is Reset; Reset discards the
// recording but not in-flight executions of earlier submissions.
//
// Pointer identity is safe for USES because every consumer holds its own COM
// reference for the object's lifetime (retirement releases last), so a
// tracked address cannot be recycled by a new allocation while tracked.
