// The status card: one card per state, decided as a pure function
// (PLAN_UI_V7.md 3).
//
// The overlay's first job is the one question a player opens it with - "is it
// working?" - and every answer it can give lives in this table.  Through
// alpha43 the answer was a ladder of funnel rungs in capitals ("EVALUATES SEEN
// - NONE WERE OURS"), which names what the ADDON saw, not what the PLAYER
// should do, and a D3D11 game running DLSS was told its DLSS was off.  The
// card names the outcome in plain language, colours it by who has to act, and
// carries the fix inline.
//
// Two rules the table must never break, both unit-asserted:
//   - a card is red only when the player must install or replace something.
//     A game without DLSS, a D3D11 game and a setting the player chose are
//     gray: nothing is wrong (the God of War lesson);
//   - every amber or red card carries its fix, not a pointer to a log.
//
// Like funnel.hpp this header has no addon dependencies (no ImGui, no
// reshade, no globals): test/dlss5 runs every row without a device.  The
// overlay renders the card; the NR-CARD log line names it, so the lanes can
// assert the card a real session reached.
