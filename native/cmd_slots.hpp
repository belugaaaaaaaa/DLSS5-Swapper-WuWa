// D3D12 vtable slots used by the compute-state shadow: the command-list
// slots it detours, and the ID3D12Device slots it detours to see lists born.
//
// Every constant in this header is checked against the SDK by the compiler:
// test/dlss5/vtable_slots.c is compiled as C, where d3d12.h exposes the COM
// vtables as plain structs, and static-asserts each index with offsetof.  A
// wrong number fails the build with the name of the slot, which is the check
// v6.7.4 did not have when it detoured ID3D12Device slot 42 believing it was
// CreateCommandSignature (it is 41; 42 is GetResourceTiling).  Do not edit a
// number here without the assertion agreeing - and do not add one without
// asserting it.
// Slot 2 (IUnknown::Release) is deliberately NOT detoured: it is the hottest
// COM method on these objects, runs on every thread, and installing its
// detour mid-frame patches a body other threads execute.  Destruction is
// learned from ReShade's destroy_command_list event instead, which costs no
// detour at all (OnDestroyCommandListEvent in dlssnr.hpp).  Through v6.7
// this comment said "no list-destruction tracking exists at all", and it was
// right for the wrong reason: the handler was there, and the registration
// was not.  The hook installer validates and detaches exactly
// kCmdHookSlots - scanning a slot-index-sized array instead once made every
// unfilled entry look like an unresolved slot and declined the whole shadow
// (v5.3.0-dev field regression on KCD2: "NR skipped: command-list state
// shadow unavailable").

// CreateCommandList hands the list back ALREADY RECORDING, in the Reset
// aftermath with the pipeline state set to the pInitialState argument -

// the KCD2 first-frame freeze the bisect later pinned on the typed-SRV
// exposure probe) to 7.0.0: a host constant set through the singular setter
// was invisible to the shadow, so the restore replayed the stale plural value
// (PLAN_REHAB_V7 section 8 item 5).  The feared foreign-DWORD replay - the
// NGX runtime's own constants recorded into the host's shadow - has been
// closed since v6.8.0-alpha9 by NgxRuntimeCommandScope; the e2e
// `singular_constant` profile holds the restore.
// ExecuteBundle joined this list in v6.8.0-alpha1.  A bundle's bindings
// persist into the parent list (MS, "Creating and Recording Command Lists and
// Bundles"), so a shadow that cannot see them restores stale state over the
// host's live state after an injection.  Measured on the trunk with the T2
// `bundles` profile: NR engaged and 119 of 120 frames ran the host's next
// dispatch under the previous pass's pipeline (PLAN_REHAB_V7.md 6.2).
// ExecuteIndirect joined it in v6.8.0-alpha8, for the same reason with the
// same kind of evidence: the T2 `gpu_driven_indirect` profile showed the
// trunk restoring a stale root constant over the zero ExecuteIndirect had
// left, on 239 of 240 frames.  It applies the exact documented aftermath and
// nothing more - a graphics signature and a dispatch-only compute signature
// change nothing at all - because the BLANKET version of this rule is what
// made Alan Wake 2 decline 912/912 evaluates on v6.7.0.  See
// indirect_signature.hpp for the quoted rule and both measurements.
