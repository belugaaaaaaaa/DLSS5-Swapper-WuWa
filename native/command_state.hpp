// Command-list compute-state observation and exact restoration
// (audit issues 02/03/04, 2026-09-16).
//
// Three cooperating pieces, all keyed by ID3D12GraphicsCommandList*:
//
//   ComputeStateFields - the observed last-write-wins compute state with
//     per-aspect KNOWLEDGE bits.  D3D12 has no state getters, so "never
//     observed" must stay distinguishable from "observed as none": the
//     ClearState aftermath (no heaps, no root signature) is exact, known
//     state, while a never-bound aspect is unknown and is never replayed
//     (replaying an unobserved value would bind garbage, not host state).
//
//   The capture window (thread-local CapturedComputeState) - what the host
//     bound during a real NGX evaluate, seeded from the persistent shadow so
//     bindings made BEFORE the window still restore (issue 03: capture
//     windows cannot recover inherited bindings on their own).
//
//   The persistent per-list shadow - host state as of the last observation,
//     striped by pointer hash with try-only locking.  Entries pin their COM
//     references so a replay can never dereference a destroyed object, and a
//     stripe that loses an observation (lock contention) drops its entries:
//     they can no longer be trusted, because the missed call may have been
//     the Reset/ClearState/destroy that invalidated them (issue 04: a parked
//     stripe must not revive stale entries when its cooldown expires).
//
// This header must stay free of addon dependencies (no reshade, no Detours,
// no logging globals): test/dlss5_gpu includes it directly to run sentinel
// restoration cases against a real device with the debug layer.  The addon
// wires its park logger through SetShadowStripeParkedLogger at init.
//
// Restore order follows the root-signature contract: heaps, then the compute
// root signature, then root arguments (only when the signature is known -
// argument indices belong to a signature layout), then the PSO.
//
// Injection is gated on ComputeStateFields::RestoreTargetComplete().  NGX
// evaluates bind nothing but descriptor heaps through the command-list
// vtable (DLSS, DLSS-RR and DLSSNR run their compute as NVAPI cubin
// launches; measured 2026-09-18), so a capture window alone never learns
// the host's signature, arguments or PSO: they come only from the persistent
// shadow, which is complete once the list's Reset or ClearState has been
// observed.  The first frame after the hooks install mid-recording
// therefore declines.
