// Where a capture window's state lives.
//
// ComputeStateEnvelope held a CapturedComputeState BY VALUE, so it sat on the
// stack of whatever thread the game chose to call the evaluate on.  That is
// 18,016 bytes (measured; test/dlss5 pins it), and 17,920 of them are the
// root-argument array: kMaxRootParameters (64) entries each carrying
// kMaxRootConstantDwords (64) DWORDs.  D3D12 caps a WHOLE root signature at
// 64 DWORDs - "The maximum size of a root signature is 64 DWORDs", descriptor
// tables and root constants 1 DWORD each, root descriptors 2 (MS, Root
// Signature Limits) - so that product is 64x anything a legal signature can
// hold.  Making the storage proportionate is worth doing and is its own
// change; this one only stops the game's thread paying for it.
//
// What it cost there, measured on the T2 `small_stack` profile:
//
//     no addon at all        64 KB  OK
//     addon loaded, NR OFF   64 KB  STACK_OVERFLOW (0xC00000FD)
//     addon loaded, NR ON    64 KB  STACK_OVERFLOW
//     addon loaded, either   72 KB  OK
//
// 64 KB is the smallest reserve Windows will give a thread, and job- and
// fiber-based engines use sizes in that region.  DLSS on its own fits; DLSS
// with this addon loaded did not - and the cost was paid with NR SWITCHED
// OFF, so turning the feature off did not get such an engine running.  The
// archived v6.5.3 gives the same two numbers, so this is a property of the
// line and not something the rehab introduced (PLAN_REHAB_V7.md R8).
//
// The state has no reason to be on that stack: it is scoped to the envelope
// and never outlives it, so a per-thread pool serves it exactly as well.  The
// pool is a stack of its own because capture windows nest - a plugin NGX
// module forwarding into the detoured core export re-enters the hooks on the
// same thread - and it is allocated once per thread that actually evaluates,
// never resized, so the pointers it hands out stay valid.
//
// Deeper than the pool, or a pool that could not be allocated, takes a
// one-off from the heap rather than declining: losing a frame of NR to save
// 18 KB would be the wrong trade, and the counter says when it happened.
//
// Dependency-free so test/dlss5 can exercise the nesting and the overflow.
