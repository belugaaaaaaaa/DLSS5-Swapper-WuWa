// The engagement funnel and the one verdict derived from it
// (PLAN_REHAB_V7.md R1).
//
// Six consecutive releases shipped with a green harness and four of them
// engaged on 0 % of evaluates in the field.  Nothing in the addon could say
// so: the overlay reported "ACTIVE - NR INJECTED" while every evaluate was
// declining, because its ladder ended at `active_features != 0` - a feature
// bound to an output, not a frame NR enhanced.  The session totals
// printed only inside Shutdown(), which a crashing or Alt-F4'd game never
// reaches.
//
// So engagement gets ONE definition, in one place, computed from counters
// that are a partition rather than a pile:
//
//   addon_loaded -> nr_enabled -> runtime_available -> ngx_hooked ->
//   dlss_feature_seen -> evaluate_seen -> evaluate_eligible ->
//   list_hooks_live -> nr_feature_ready -> gate_open -> injected ->
//   submitted_ok
//
// The verdict names the FIRST stage that did not happen, which is the only
// thing a reporter needs to send and the only thing a triager needs to read.
//
// This header stays free of addon dependencies (no reshade, no NGX, no
// Detours, no logging globals): the decision is a pure function of a plain
// struct, so test/dlss5 can run every rung of the ladder - including the ones
// that need a 100 %-decline session - without a device or a game.
