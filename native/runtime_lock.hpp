// runtime_mutex, with the lock order it is supposed to keep made visible.
//
// One non-recursive mutex serializes the whole addon: the feature map, the
// hook installs, the per-present lifecycle, device init and shutdown.  Three
// places in dlssnr.hpp already say, in comments, that it must not be held
// across a call into the Windows loader --
//
//   "discovery (phase 1) runs WITHOUT runtime_mutex because GetModuleHandleW
//    ... take[s] the loader lock - holding runtime_mutex across such a wait
//    can deadlock with a DllMain on another thread"           (InstallHooks)
//   "Discovery without runtime_mutex (GetModuleHandleW takes the loader
//    lock; ...)"                                    (InstallStreamlineHooks)
//   "GetModuleHandleW needs the loader lock, which is why it runs here,
//    outside runtime_mutex"                                      (OnPresent)
//
// -- and the evaluate path does exactly what those three avoid.  The first
// engaged evaluate of a session runs
//
//   HookedEvaluateFeature -> scoped_lock(runtime_mutex) -> ProcessInline
//     -> EnsureDirectRuntime -> LoadDirectApi -> LoadLibraryW(nvngx_dlssnr)
//
// so thread A holds runtime_mutex and waits on the loader lock, while any
// thread B inside a DllMain (which Windows runs holding the loader lock) that
// reaches OnPresent, a hooked NGX export, OnInitDevice or Shutdown waits on
// runtime_mutex.  That is the textbook inversion, and both halves are on
// paths a game takes without doing anything unusual: games load modules on
// worker threads all session long, and DLSS itself is loaded from one.
//
// The rule cannot be enforced by the type system the way direct_call.hpp's
// can, because the loader is reached through the Win32 API.  So it is
// enforced the next best way: it is COUNTED.  Every call into the loader made
// while this thread holds runtime_mutex increments
// `runtime_lock_loader_calls` and records its site name; the telemetry line
// carries both, and a T2 lane fails on a non-zero count.  An invariant with a
// number attached is one a regression trips over.
//
// The same wrapper answers the other half of the R8 row - how long the lock
// is actually held - without paying for a clock on every acquisition.  An
// uncontended acquisition costs what std::scoped_lock cost (one atomic
// exchange, via try_lock) and reads no clock at all; only an acquisition that
// really had to block takes timestamps, and there the two clock reads are
// dwarfed by the wait being measured.  So `runtime_lock_wait_max_ns` is the
// worst stall a thread took waiting for this mutex, measured in the field, at
// no cost to sessions where the lock is never contended.
//
// Dependency-free so test/dlss5 can exercise the depth and the counter.
