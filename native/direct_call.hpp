// "This thread is currently inside the signed NGX runtime."
//
// The addon detours four NGX exports, and it also CALLS those exports itself
// (init, create, evaluate, release, shutdown).  Without a fence, its own call
// re-enters its own detour: the wrapper would try to re-lock the
// non-recursive runtime_mutex on this thread and deadlock, and the
// command-state shadow would record the runtime's own binds as if the host
// had made them.  The fence is this per-thread flag.
//
// Until v6.8.0 it was a bare `inline thread_local bool` raised and lowered by
// hand at seven call sites, and three of them (feature release, retired
// feature release, direct Shutdown) had no exception handling at all.  The
// failure that costs is silent and permanent: a C++ exception escaping the
// runtime skips the `= false`, the flag stays raised for the LIFE OF THE
// THREAD, and from then on SuppressCommandStateObservation() is true on every
// call - so the shadow stops learning, every evaluate on that thread declines
// for a missing restore target, and nothing says why.  The mod appears to
// switch itself off mid-session on one thread and keep working on the others
// (PLAN_REHAB_V7.md, R8).
//
// Two things are fixed by moving it here rather than by adding four more
// try/catch blocks:
//
//  1. The reset is a destructor, so it runs on every exit from the scope -
//     return, break, or a C++ exception - without the site having to
//     remember.  (It is NOT a defence against an access violation in the
//     runtime: this addon is built /EHsc, where `catch (...)` does not catch
//     SEH and a structured unwind is not required to run C++ destructors.
//     The four sites that carry `catch (...)` never caught the driver faults
//     in the crash reports either - see the R8 row - and no claim to the
//     contrary belongs in the README.)
//  2. The flag is PRIVATE, with Scope its only friend, so `inside_direct_call
//     = true` no longer compiles.  The invariant is held by the compiler
//     rather than by a reviewer noticing the eighth site - which is the same
//     reason vtable_slots.c is a pile of _Static_asserts.
//
// A depth counter, not a bool, for the same reason InjectedCommandScope is
// one: an inner scope must not lower the fence the outer scope raised.
//
// Dependency-free on purpose, so test/dlss5 can include it and pin the
// behaviour that matters - that the fence falls when the scope is left by an
// exception, and that nesting restores rather than clears.
