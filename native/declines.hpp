// The decline taxonomy: every way an evaluate can end without NR running.
//
// The compatibility policy behind it is that the worst failure mode of this
// mod is silently doing nothing.  So every evaluate-path terminal bumps a
// NAMED counter and logs its first occurrence, Shutdown prints the session
// totals, and the verdict line (funnel.hpp) reports the largest one.  A
// terminal with no counter is the bug this table exists to prevent: it makes
// the engagement ratio a guess, because `eligible - injected - sum(declines)`
// stops being zero (T-SILENT).
//
// This header is deliberately free of addon dependencies so test/dlss5 can
// include it and pin the table: the tags are a field contract - they appear
// in telemetry that users paste and tools parse - and an array that falls out
// of step with the enum is a silent mislabelling of every counter after the
// gap.

  kNestedMirror,

  // EnsureDirectRuntime fails and the evaluate ends.  Both injection paths
  // returned false here without counting anything, which is the single most
  // likely state for a machine this mod has never worked on - measured by
  // the `no_nr_runtime` lane on its first run: 240 eligible evaluates, one
  // named decline, `unaccounted=239`.  The verdict already said UNAVAILABLE

  // the promise that it does not.
  kNrRuntimeUnavailable,
  // v6.8.0-alpha34 (item 19): the evaluate wrapper's unnamed early-outs.
  // The disabled early-out is the big one - every evaluate that streamed
  // past a live hook set while NR was off landed in `unaccounted` (7807 of
  // them in the MSFS2024 field log of a healthy session), so its ratio read

  // D3D12 evaluate is not ours to inject.  INELIGIBLE: it never competes
  // for the engagement ratio.  Named in the taxonomy in P4 so the build
  // that wires the native path cannot mislabel it; nothing counts it in P4
  // - the shipped 'foreign' default serves every D3D12 evaluate and names
  // no decline (the double-processing ride is the intended Path A behavior;
  // any gate on it is P5 B7, observe-only first).

  // v7.0.0 (A-1): the evaluate's first argument is not a readable object -
  // the Skyrim SE class, a third-party caller's sentinel such as 0xFFFFFFFF
  // (arg_plausibility.hpp).  The wrapper skips every dereference of its own
  // and hands the call to the real export, so the frame is not a usable one:

  //   bridge_busy    - every submission in the ring is still on the GPU;
